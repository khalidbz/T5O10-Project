I will describe the project proposed model and the tools.  

### Project Description:
The project will use the dataset of IMDb in purpose of building a model to examine and predict which genre of movies will win the audience reception and acceptance within upcoming years based on several factors such as: Box office reception, Ratings, Views, and others. This model will benefit the filmmakers, top leaders and producers in film industry to know which kind of movies the audience prefer to watch to grantee the financial return.

### Tools: 
Here the expected tools which will be used to build the mentioned model. 
-	Data Processing: Numpy, Pandas. 
-	Modle: Random Forest.
-	Visualizations: Matpltlib.
